**Project title**
Palindrome checker

**Project Description**
### The idea behind this project
Palindromes are those numbers that give the same result whether you read from left or right.

### How does it work
We have a container with a field and button fill any word number there and check whether it is palindrome or not.

**Stack**:  
And in order to tick the check box just put x inside them for example - [x] like this. Please delete options that are not relevant.

- [x] Html
- [x] CSS
- [x] JavaScript
