#  Flip Book Of Mathematics Short Tricks
it'll be a digital book with 50 pages of maths short tricks ...
the app is made keeping in mind the optimization of the Code.
all the data and content of the book is fetching from JSON API made by me only which contains images of the book which is photoshopped to attach the photos to the pages ....if one has to change the content of the book .... you just have to change the data of JSON .
it also has secret games in between .... who doesn't like surprises
