### Description

### The idea behind this project :
Like nowadays we often use QR code scanners example can be taken as digital payment that we are doing in the bulk  

### How does it work
Just on the base of random thinking, I decided can't make a QR code generator. For this project, you just need to enter your name or any URL and click generate button you will be able to generate the QR of the respective URL and name.

for more details please refer to the attached images.
