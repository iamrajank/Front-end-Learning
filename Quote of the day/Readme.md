### Description

**Project Description**
### The idea behind this project
This is the project based on the API fetching for a quote where we refresh the page and each time get introduced with the new quote.

### How does it work
While loading the page you will have the container with some social media icons and random quotes with the author name there is a refresh type button if you will click on it will preview a new quote for you.
